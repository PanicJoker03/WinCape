# WinCape

WinCape is a general Win32Api wrapper. The philosophy behind the code is to hide all the macros, functions and legacy stuff from the win 32 api.


## Build

It was originaly compiled on visual studio, now I use cevelop to make the build. Soon I will share the g++ command to build the .exe. Anyway, you should have installed mingw32 to procced. 

You can download Cevelop [here](https://www.cevelop.com/download/).
And a usefull mingw32 installation guide [here](https://www.msys2.org/) on the MSYS2 website, just follow the steps to get mingw32 installed on your machine.

**Cpp, Hell Yeah!**
